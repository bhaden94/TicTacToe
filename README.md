# TicTacToe
GUI Tic Tac Toe game using Java

This program uses a 2d array to display a grid of buttons.
'X' always goes first and each time a button is pressed it is updated with either
an 'O' or 'X' depending on the turn.

Below are some screenshots of the program is action. I am working on adding a 
GIF showing a game being played.
